The starter code implements a basic framework for training neural nets with mini-batch gradient descent. Your job is to write code to complete the implementation of forward and back propagation. See the README file for a description of the dataset, starter code and how to run it.

This sample_output shows you what output to expect once everything is implemented correctly.
